# Probabilistic-Problem

In this project, a drone delivery company is operating in an environment consisting of a rectangular grid, packages, and clients. The company uses drones to deliver packages to clients. The environment can be represented as a list of lists, where each point on the grid represents an area that may or may not be passable for the drones. The clients move around the grid according to pre-determined paths or probabilistically. The company's goal is to deliver packages to clients in the shortest amount of time possible. To achieve this, the company can issue various actions to the drones, including moving the drones on the grid, picking up packages, delivering packages to clients, and waiting. The company can also reset the environment or terminate the execution early. The company is awarded points for successful package deliveries and can lose points for resetting the environment. The company's task is to implement a class, DroneAgent, with a constructor and a function that returns a global action based on a given state.
